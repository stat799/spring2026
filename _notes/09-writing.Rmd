# Communicating results 

*February 9th, 2026* 


## Scientific writing 

- **Introduction** 
  - More general --> more specific 
  - Last paragraph states the knowledge gap, and clearly mentions objectives. 
  - Using wording like "the objectives were ..."

## Communicating statistical analyses 

- Discipline-specific criteria
- Statistical notation versus rhetoric  

Some examples from this class

## Communicating results and uncertainty

Communicating point estimates is relatively easy. So far, we can consider the point estimate the value with maximum likelihood to have generated the data. If we had to bet on a particular number, that would probably be the point estimate. Now, if we had to bet on a *range* of values, the width of that range would depend on the information in the data. 

**Confidence intervals** 

Confidence intervals are one of the most frequently mis-interpreted quantities. 

- **A safe approach**: "The mean is between `CIlow` and `CIhigh` [units], with 95% confidence."
- Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretation [[link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-016-0149-3)]

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(lme4)
library(emmeans)
```


### Example 

The data below come from a split-plot designed experiment in complete blocks, with fungicide in the whole plot and genotype in the split plot. The model is 

$$y_{ijk} | b_k, u_{j(k)} \sim N(\mu_{ijk}, \sigma^2_\varepsilon), \\ \mu_{ijk} = \mu + G_i + F_j + GF_{ij} + b_k + u_{j(k)}, \\ b_k \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b) , \ u_{j(k)} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u),$$

where $y_{ijk}$ is the data that we assume is normally distributed, $\mu_{ijk}$ is the mean and $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$ is the variance. 
The linear predictor of $\mu_{ijk}$ is the sum of an overall mean $\mu$, the effect of the $i$th genotype $G_i$, the effect of the $j$th fungicide $F_j$, 
the interaction between the $i$th genotype and $j$th fungicide $GF_{ij}$, the random effect of the $k$th block $b_k$, and the random whole-plot effect of the $j$th fungicide in the $k$th block $u_{j(k)}$. Both random effects are assumed independent to each other and to the residual.  

```{r}
dat_multilevel <- agridat::durban.splitplot

m_multilevel <- lmer(yield ~ gen*fung + (1|block/fung), data = dat_multilevel)

fung_mgmeans <- emmeans(m_multilevel, ~fung)

as.data.frame(fung_mgmeans) |> 
  ggplot(aes(emmean, fung))+
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower.CL, xmax = upper.CL), width = 0)+
  geom_point(size = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(y = "Fungicide", x = expression(Yield~(Mg~ha^{-1})))+
  theme(aspect.ratio = .2)
```

### Hypothesis tests and p-values

Hypothesis test evaluate the probability of observing the current data under a null hypothesis. When that probability is very low, we consider that is it very unlikely that the data were generated by that hypothesis, and we move on to an alternative hypothesis.

**What we need:** 

- A null hypothesis $H_0$ representing the current paradigm or beliefs 
- An alternative hypothesis $H_a$  

**What we get:** 

- An answer rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis. 

**Things to consider:**

- The question reflected in some $H_0$ is not always the real research question. 
- The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant [[link](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)]
- ASA's statement on p-values [[link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#d1e167)]


**Different types of hypothesis tests**

- t-tests 
- ANOVA -- F test ~ multivariate t-test
- Post-hoc mean comparisons 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# simple marginal means + contrast (t test)
emmeans(m_multilevel, ~fung, contr = list(c(1,-1)))

# ANOVA
car::Anova(m_multilevel, type = 2, test.statistic = "F")

# multiple comparison
library(multcomp)
means_gen <- emmeans(m_multilevel, ~gen)
(mean_comparisons_gen <- 
  cld(means_gen,
      level = 0.05,
      adjust = "sidak",
      Letters = letters))
```

### Other results in mixed-effects models 

**Variance components** 

Recall that 

$$y_{ijk} | b_k, u_{j(k)} \sim N(\mu_{ijk}, \sigma^2_\varepsilon), \\ \mu_{ijk} = \mu + G_i + F_j + GF_{ij} + b_k + u_{j(k)}, \\ b_k \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b) , \ u_{j(k)} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u) $$

represents the conditional distribution of $y$. 

At that level, the uncertainty is only coming from observing new data, $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$. We could, however, obtain $y$s for all blocks and whole plots *in general*, where the uncertainty will represent (i) observing new data, (ii) observing new blocks, and (iii) observing new whole plots. 


```{r}
VarCorr(m_multilevel)
```
