Grades: A (100-89.999999999(!!!)), B (89.99-79.99), C (79.99-69.99), D (69.99-59.99), F (&lt;59.99). Attendance policies Semester projects 1.2 Learning goals By the end of this course, you should be able to: - Be able to identify the treatment design, experiment design, experimental unit and observational unit. - Be able to write the statistical model that corresponds to (simple) designed experiments. - Be able to write the Materials and Methods section in a paper (or thesis) that describes the designed experiment. - Distinguish the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs. 1.3 On notation scalars: \\(y\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\beta_0\\) vectors: \\(\\mathbf{y} \\equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\equiv [\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) matrices: \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), \\(\\Sigma\\) probability distribution: \\(y \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I})\\).

Broadly, projects are expected to identify a research problem and develop a designed experiment that is appropriate for solving that problem. Projects consist of a manuscript and a tutorial that describes the research problem, the experiment design and the treatment design. 3.1 Learning objectives 3.2 Partial deadlines 3.2.1 Project proposal - Due Friday January 30 at 4pm CT Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. 3.2.2 Written report - Due Wednesday April 20 at 2pm CT for peer review Submit a manuscript to one of your classmates. The manuscript must include Abstract (250w), Introduction (~500w), M&amp;M (~300-500w), Results (~400w), Discussion (~400w), Conclusions (~100w). 3.2.3 Oral presentation - Somewhere between May 1 - May 9 Prepare a 15 minute presentation of the core aspects of your project. Presentations should include at least: Motivation/Background Methods, including a clear and complete description of the statistical model and code Discussion of strengths and weaknesses Conclusions 3.2.4 Written report and reproducible tutorial - Due May 15 Manuscript must include a publication-ready analysis. Must include Abstract (250w), Introduction (~500w), M&amp;M (~300-500w), Results (~400w), Discussion (~400w), Conclusions (~100w). Last paragraph in the Introduction should clearly state the research gap and the research objectives.
